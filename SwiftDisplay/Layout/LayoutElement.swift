/**
 * The ASLayoutElement protocol declares a method for measuring the layout of an object. A layout
 * is defined by an ASLayout return value, and must specify 1) the size (but not position) of the
 * layoutElement object, and 2) the size and position of all of its immediate child objects. The tree
 * recursion is driven by parents requesting layouts from their children in order to determine their
 * size, followed by the parents setting the position of the children once the size is known
 *
 * The protocol also implements a "family" of LayoutElement protocols. These protocols contain layout
 * options that can be used for specific layout specs. For example, ASStackLayoutSpec has options
 * defining how a layoutElement should shrink or grow based upon available space.
 *
 * These layout options are all stored in an ASLayoutOptions class (that is defined in ASLayoutElementPrivate).
 * Generally you needn't worry about the layout options class, as the layoutElement protocols allow all direct
 * access to the options via convenience properties. If you are creating custom layout spec, then you can
 * extend the backing layout options class to accommodate any new layout options.
