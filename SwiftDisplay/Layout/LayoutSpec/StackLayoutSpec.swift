/**
 A simple layout spec that stacks a list of children vertically or horizontally.
 
 - All children are initially laid out with the an infinite available size in the stacking direction.
 - In the other direction, this spec's constraint is passed.
 - The children's sizes are summed in the stacking direction.
 - If this sum is less than this spec's minimum size in stacking direction, children with flexGrow are flexed.
 - If it is greater than this spec's maximum size in the stacking direction, children with flexShrink are flexed.
 - If, even after flexing, the sum is still greater than this spec's maximum size in the stacking direction,
 justifyContent determines how children are laid out.
 
 For example:
 
 - Suppose stacking direction is Vertical, min-width=100, max-width=300, min-height=200, max-height=500.
 - All children are laid out with min-width=100, max-width=300, min-height=0, max-height=INFINITY.
 - If the sum of the childrens' heights is less than 200, children with flexGrow are flexed larger.
 - If the sum of the childrens' heights is greater than 500, children with flexShrink are flexed smaller.
 Each child is shrunk by `((sum of heights) - 500)/(number of flexShrink-able children)`.
 - If the sum of the childrens' heights is greater than 500 even after flexShrink-able children are flexed,
 justifyContent determines how children are laid out.
